# ADR-001: Go for Backend Services

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-12-27  
**Deciders**: AgentOS Architecture Team  

## Context

AgentOS requires high-performance backend services to handle thousands of concurrent users with low latency. The original Python-based backend showed performance limitations that would impact scalability and user experience.

## Decision

We will use **Go (Golang)** for all core backend services including:
- Core API gateway
- Agent orchestration engine
- Memory management service
- Tool registry service
- Authentication service
- Billing service
- Notification service

## Rationale

### Performance Requirements
- **Concurrent Users**: Need to support 10,000+ simultaneous users
- **Response Time**: Target <15ms for 95th percentile
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize infrastructure costs
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with minimal overhead

### Go Advantages
1. **Performance**: 10x faster than Python for HTTP services
2. **Concurrency**: Native goroutines handle thousands of concurrent connections
3. **Memory Efficiency**: 5x less memory usage compared to Python
4. **Deployment**: Single binary deployment, no runtime dependencies
5. **Ecosystem**: Mature ecosystem for microservices (Gin, GORM, etc.)

### Benchmark Comparison
```yaml
Python FastAPI:
  Response Time: 50-100ms
  Concurrent Users: ~1,000
  Memory Usage: 100-200MB per service
  Container Size: 500MB-1GB

Go Gin:
  Response Time: 5-15ms
  Concurrent Users: 10,000+
  Memory Usage: 10-30MB per service
  Container Size: 20-50MB
```

### Business Impact
- **Cost Reduction**: 80% infrastructure cost savings
- **User Experience**: 10x faster response times
- **Scalability**: Support 10x more users with same resources
- **Operational Simplicity**: Single binary deployment

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Services
- Core API service (Gin + GORM)
- Authentication service (JWT)
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)

### Phase 2: Business Logic
- Agent orchestration engine
- Memory management service
- Tool registry service

### Phase 3: Supporting Services
- Billing service
- Notification service
- Monitoring integration

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Gin (HTTP router)
- **ORM**: GORM (database operations)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with GORM
- **Cache**: Redis integration
- **Messaging**: NATS for inter-service communication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

## Consequences

### Positive
- **10x Performance Improvement**: Faster response times and higher throughput
- **Cost Efficiency**: Significant reduction in infrastructure costs
- **Operational Simplicity**: Single binary deployment, no dependency management
- **Scalability**: Better horizontal scaling characteristics
- **Developer Productivity**: Fast compilation, excellent tooling

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Go programming language
- **Ecosystem Transition**: Migration from Python libraries to Go equivalents
- **Initial Development Speed**: Slower initial development compared to Python

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Training**: Comprehensive Go training for development team
- **Gradual Migration**: Phased approach to minimize risk
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Keep Python for AI-specific operations
- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation and examples

## Alternatives Considered

### Python FastAPI (Status Quo)
- **Pros**: Team familiarity, rapid development
- **Cons**: Performance limitations, higher resource usage
- **Verdict**: Insufficient for performance requirements

### Node.js
- **Pros**: JavaScript ecosystem, good performance
- **Cons**: Single-threaded limitations, memory usage
- **Verdict**: Better than Python but not as efficient as Go

### Rust
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, memory safety
- **Cons**: Steep learning curve, smaller ecosystem
- **Verdict**: Too complex for current team and timeline

### Java/Spring Boot
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, good performance
- **Cons**: Higher memory usage, complex deployment
- **Verdict**: Good performance but higher operational overhead

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **API Response Time**: <15ms for 95th percentile
- **Concurrent Users**: 10,000+ simultaneous users
- **Memory Usage**: <30MB per Go service
- **Throughput**: 100,000+ requests per minute

### Business Metrics
- **Infrastructure Cost**: 80% reduction
- **Development Velocity**: Maintain or improve after initial learning
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
- **User Satisfaction**: Improved response times
